I am a final-year B.Sc. (Hons) Statistics undergraduate at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with a strong interest in data science and analytics. My academic and project experience has equipped me with skills in statistical modeling, data visualization, analytical problem-solving, and programming using R and Python.
